## Review Notes for Google

```
This extension is a developer tool for error tracking and debugging.

PERMISSIONS JUSTIFICATION:

1. "storage" - Required to save user's whitelist preferences (which sites have tracking enabled).

2. "activeTab" - Required to detect the current website's domain to show in the popup and check whitelist status.

3. "tabs" - Required to get the current tab's URL for domain detection and whitelist checking.

4. "host_permissions: <all_urls>" - Required to inject error capture scripts into websites the user chooses to monitor. This permission is ONLY used on sites the user explicitly enables via the whitelist. By default, the extension is inactive on all sites.

DATA HANDLING:
- All captured error data is sent ONLY to the user's local server (localhost:5000 by default)
- No data is ever sent to external servers
- No personal information is collected
- Users have full control over which sites are monitored

The extension is open source and can be inspected at: github.com/Nati41/FixOnce
