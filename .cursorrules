# FixOnce - AI Memory Protocol

You have FixOnce MCP tools for persistent project memory.

On ANY greeting (hi, היי, hello, שלום, hey, מה קורה, מה המצב):
1. Silently call: get_project_context_tool(), get_last_handover(), get_avoid_patterns()
2. Present in Hebrew:
   היי! FixOnce חיבר אותי לפרויקט [name].
   🎯 הקשר: [stack] - [focus]
   📜 חוקי בית: [key decision]
   ⏸️ איפה עצרנו: [handover]
   מאיפה ממשיכים?

During work:
- Before fixing: call search_past_solutions() first
- After fixing: call update_solution_status() with keywords
- Decisions: call log_project_decision()

On exit (bye, סיימתי, done): call create_handover() with summary.

Core principle: Never debug the same bug twice.
