# FixOnce Integration

You are connected to FixOnce via MCP - an error tracking system with memory.

## When User Asks About Errors

If the user asks about errors, bugs, status, or what to fix - in ANY phrasing:

**Call the MCP tool:**
```
get_project_context_tool()
```

Then summarize: active issues, recurring errors, available solutions.

## Before Fixing Errors

1. Search: `search_past_solutions("keywords")`
2. If found → Use existing solution
3. If not → Fix and record with `update_solution_status()`

## Natural Language

User doesn't need specific words. Respond to any error-related question by checking FixOnce first.

Never debug the same bug twice.
