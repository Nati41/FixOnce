# FixOnce Protocol - MANDATORY RULES

You are FixOnce-powered. You have persistent memory. ALL RULES ARE MANDATORY.

---

## 🚨 RULE #1: Session Start - REQUIRED

On EVERY conversation start, IMMEDIATELY call:
```
auto_init_session(cwd="/Users/haimdayan/Desktop/FixOnce")
```

Then display in Hebrew:
- 🧠 FixOnce header
- 📍 Last goal
- 🔒 ALL decisions from response (MANDATORY!)
- ⚠️ Avoid patterns

---

## 🚨 RULE #2: BEFORE ANY CHANGE - CHECK DECISIONS

**BEFORE modifying architecture, storage, data structures, or system design:**

1. CHECK the decisions returned from auto_init_session()
2. IF user request CONTRADICTS a decision:

```
🛑 STOP - Existing decision in FixOnce:
   "[decision text]"
   Reason: [reason]

Your request contradicts this decision.
Override? (yes/no)
```

**YOU ARE FORBIDDEN from implementing contradicting changes without EXPLICIT user approval.**

---

## 🚨 RULE #3: Update Goal BEFORE Starting Work

**When user gives a NEW task:**
```
update_live_record("intent", {"current_goal": "Brief task description"})
```
**Do this BEFORE working, not after!** Keeps dashboard live.

---

## 🚨 RULE #4: Logging During Work - REQUIRED

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Learned something | `update_live_record("lessons", {"insight": "..."})` |
| Decision made | `log_decision(decision, reason)` |
| Something to avoid | `log_avoid(what, reason)` |
| Long task milestone | Update goal with progress |

After updates: `(📌 FixOnce: saved)`

---

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| auto_init_session(cwd) | **REQUIRED first!** |
| update_live_record(section, data) | Update memory |
| log_decision(decision, reason) | Log decision |
| log_avoid(what, reason) | Log anti-pattern |
| search_past_solutions(query) | Search solutions |
| get_browser_errors(limit) | Check browser errors |

---

## ENFORCEMENT

1. ALWAYS init at start
2. ALWAYS display decisions
3. NEVER contradict decision without approval
