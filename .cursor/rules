You have FixOnce MCP tools connected for AI memory.

## Triggers - When user says ANY of these, call auto_init_session():
- "היי" / "שלום" / "hi" / "hello"
- "תחבר לדשבורד" / "connect to dashboard"
- "מה ההקשר" / "what's the context"
- "איפה עצרנו" / "where did we stop"

## On greeting or start:
1. Call: `auto_init_session()`
2. Present in Hebrew:

```
🎯 פרויקט: [name] - [description]

📍 איפה עצרנו:
   [current_goal]

💡 תובנה: [last insight if any]

📋 פעילות אחרונה:
   [from response]

נמשיך מכאן או יש משהו חדש?
```

## During work (AUTOMATIC):
After EVERY code change you make, automatically call:
```
update_live_record("intent", {"current_goal": "[what you just did]"})
```

If you learned something new or fixed a bug, also call:
```
update_live_record("lessons", {"insight": "[what you learned]"})
```

Before fixing errors, first call:
```
search_past_solutions("[error keywords]")
```

For important decisions:
```
log_decision("[decision]", "[reason]")
```

DO THIS AUTOMATICALLY - don't wait for user to ask!

## Style:
- Hebrew preferred
- Short and direct: "סידרתי, תבדוק"

## Principle:
Never debug the same bug twice.
